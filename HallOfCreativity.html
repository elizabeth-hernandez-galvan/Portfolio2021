        <h1 class="text-left"><strong>Project Summary</strong></H1>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a landing page for a new museum or event. I decided to to create Hall of Creativity which  is a new art museum featuring emerging artists. It displays do it DIY (Do It Yourself) projects that anyone is able to replicate with a focus on reusing common materials. All users will have the opportunity to learn and contribute to the museum.</p>

        <h1 class="text-left"><strong>Problem Statement</strong></H1>
        <p>Many museums and art galleries feature well known artists making it difficult for new artists to showcase their artwork. Also, with schools trying to focus on the sciences, many children from a young age arenâ€™t given the chance to be creative and explore their artistic side.</p>

    <section class="m-5">
        <h1 class="text-left"><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></H1>
        <p>I did a competitive analysis to compare the landing page features on other museums looking at there differences and similarities.<br> Based on these sites, I concluded all these sites had some sort of interactivity which helped highlight their events. I also noticed a horizontal menu worked            better than a vertical menu as it was easier to navigate. Lastly, I determined the Fat Footer served as a summary highlighting the most important parts of each website.</p>

        <h1 class="text-left"><strong>Personas</strong></H1>
        <p>After looking over my goals, I decided two different personas would best represent my target audience. My target audience would consist of both parents and beginning artists like students. Based off the assumption that the museum, Hall of Creativity, already had some artist participation, my target audience focus shifted to parents.</p>

    <section class="m-5">
        <h1 class="text-left"><strong>Wireframes</strong></H1>
        <p>Once I had my target audience, I started making wireframes for how the landing page would look like testing out different layouts and features that should be included. I started by sketching low fidelity frames and from there transitioned to a high fidelity frame.</p>

        <h1 class="text-left"><strong>Visual Design</strong></H1>
        <p>After I had made a Figma draft of my landing page design and received feedback on the content and visuals. I began looking at the color scheme before moving on to the final stages of my prototype. By the end, I was deciding between two different color palettes grayscale and blue-yellow. Ultimately, I decided to stick to grayscale as the text would be easier to read and the pictures would be highlighted more due to their color.</p>

        <h1 class="text-left"><strong>Prototype</strong></H1>
        <p>My final solution is a landing page which is not only viewable on a desktop but also mobile friendly. The second desktop version includes hover states in both the buttons and navigation menu. The different prototype versions can be viewed using the links below:</p>

        <h1 class="text-left"><strong>Conclusion</strong></H1>
        <p>Overall, I found this project to be really beneficial to understanding the importance of user centered design as well as continuing to learn Figma. If this website had been based on a real museum, User Interviews would have been extremely helpful in determining the problem from the user perspective. From this project, I learned the importance of storytelling when designing and will use this new takeaway when working on future projects.</p>
